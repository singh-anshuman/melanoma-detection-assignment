## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution has to be build which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

## Conclusions
- Conclusion from the training Model 1
- Conclusion from the training Model 2
- Conclusion from the training Model 3

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.12.3
- Tensor Flow - version 2.18.0
- Keras - version 3.18.0
- Augmentor - version 0.2.12
